# Fireblob and Purpleblob

## Purpose
Fireblob and Purpleblob is a beginner friendly 2-player game that encourages teamwork between the 2 players to advance. This game is heavily inspired by the iconic Fireboy and Watergirl game and was created as a project to bring the game back for old players and introduce new players to the game. The goal is to combine teamwork and problem solving skills to navigate through the levels together.

## How to Run and play
To run the game simply you could play directly on the replit project or fork it if you would prefer. The game uses a straightforward interface for users to navigate through the menu and levels with ease. The purple blob uses the controls W to jump, a to move left and D to move right. The Fireblob uses the arrow keys using moving in the respective directions of the arrows except down.

## How to Download and Run Game

## Limitations and Future Updates
Currently, the game is a work in progress (WIP) with only one level of the 3 levels completed. The settings has yet to be added and will not open as of now. We are actively working on adding the remaining levels. In the future, we plan to introduce animations, music and settings to enhance the gaming experience. Please note that as the game is in its development phase, you may encounter some bugs or issues. We appreciate your understanding and patience.
